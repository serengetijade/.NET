# C_Sharp
This repository is for C# and .NET projects

## PROJECTS:
- [MVC Signup Form](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_SignupForm/MVC_SignupForm)
- [MVC Project](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_Project/MVC_Project)
- [MadLib Game](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/MadLibGame/MadLibGame/Program.cs)
- [WebApp Tutorial](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/WebAppTutorial)

#### [MVC Signup Form](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_SignupForm/MVC_SignupForm)
a signup form Web Application made using the entity framework and the Model View Controller design pattern. It uses HTML forms to create and modify records.
- CRUD functionality. 
- An Admin page displays DB records.
- An HTML form applies a method to "unsubscribe" records from the admin page. 
- View Models are used to keep sensitive information out of views.
- Applied lambda expressions and built-in .Where method to pass only relevent database records to the view.

#### [MVC Project](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_Project/MVC_Project)
the barebones skeleton of an Model View Controller design framework to demonstrate how to create model objects, add views, and use Razor tags with C# code.

#### [MadLib Game](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/MadLibGame/MadLibGame/Program.cs)
a fun console application that takes in user input and creates a short madlib story. It shows basic C# functionality including assigning data types, switch statements, foreach loops, boolean values, and more. It's fun, you should try it.

#### [WebApp Tutorial](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/WebAppTutorial)
a 15 minute mini project to demonstrate how C# scaffolding can make spinning up a basic web page super quick and easy. It has a few basic HTML elements, uses a shared Layout page with navigation bar, and implements CSS and JavaScript.

## [REFERENCE CODE LIBRARY](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp)
In addition to the projects, there is a small code library for referencing basic C# elements. These examples are heavily noted and written as though for a console application. 
- [Basics](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/CSharp_Basics/CSharpBasics/Program.cs) Start here for the fundamentals.
- [Abstract Classes](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/Program.cs) Abstract classes and polymorphism.
- [Abstract Class](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass) An abstract class, aka a base class, is a generic (template) class or type of object that is used as a basis for creating other objects that conform with its specifications.  
- [Arrays and Lists](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ArraysLists/ConsoleApp_ArraysLists/Program.cs) Syntax for arrays and lists. 
- [Chained Constructors](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ChainedConstructors/ConsoleApp_ChainedConstructors) A chained constructor allows programmers to define “default” values for class instances accounting for which property values are passed in when the constructor is called. 
- [DateTime](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_DateTime/ConsoleApp_DateTime/Program.cs) Code examples using type DateTime.
- [Enums](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Enums/ConsoleApp_Enums/Program.cs) An enum is a data type that consists of a set of named values, called elements/members/enumerals/or enumerators. 
- [Exception Handling](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ExceptionHandling/ConsoleApp_ExceptionHandling) Try catch blocks and exception codes.
- [FileIO](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_FileIO_LogToTxtFile/ConsoleApp_FileIO_LogToTxtFile/Program.cs) The FileIO library and how to log to text files. 
- [Lambda](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Lambda/ConsoleApp_Lambda) Using lambda expressions, you can write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the value of function calls.
- [Methods](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Methods/ConsoleApp_Methods) The basics of C# methods. 
- [Methods and Objects](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_MethodsAndObjects/ConsoleApp_MethodsAndObjects) How to declare objects and their properties, instantiate objects, use var variables, and define methods.
- [Overloaded Operators](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_OverloadOperators/ConsoleApp_OverloadOperators) A coding approach to provide custom implementation of an operation in case one or both of the operands are of that type. 
- [Strings](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Strings/ConsoleApp_Strings/Program.cs)
- [Structs](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Structs/ConsoleApp_Structs) A structure is a value Type used to make a single variable that holds related data of various data types. 
- [Switch](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Switch/ConsoleApp_Switch/Program.cs) The basics of branching statemetns with the switch keyword.
