#### [ASP.NET Entity Framework Project](https://github.com/serengetijade/Project_ASP.NET_EF_Website)
An in depth C# project using MVC and Entity Framework to create a website for a theatre company. The focus was to create a database to handle comments on the blog seciton of the site, as well as to upload images to the blog photos section.

#### [MVC Signup Form](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_SignupForm/MVC_SignupForm)
A signup form Web Application made using the entity framework and the Model View Controller design pattern. It uses HTML forms to create and modify records.
- CRUD functionality. 
- An Admin page displays DB records.
- An HTML form applies a method to "unsubscribe" records from the admin page. 
- View Models are used to keep sensitive information out of views.
- Applied lambda expressions and built-in .Where method to pass only relevent database records to the view.

#### [MVC Basic Project](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/MVC_Project/MVC_Project)
This is a very basic expample of a web application to demonstrate the structure of a Model View Controller (MVC) design framework. The simple code shows how to create model objects, use a class constructor to create instances of objects, connect multiple views, use a layout file, and implement Razor tags with C# code.

#### [MadLib Game](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/MadLibGame/MadLibGame/Program.cs)
A fun console application that takes in user input and creates a short madlib story. It shows basic C# functionality including assigning data types, switch statements, foreach loops, boolean values, and more. It's fun, you should try it.

#### [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/TwentyOneGame)
A console application to recreate the popular game of Twenty One, aka Black Jack. This project creates a library that is meant to be leveraged to other card games. The coding is generic to allow for future customization and reuse.
- Calculated hand values using lambda functions.
- Created multiple classes.
- Implement class constructors.
- Used overloaded operators to add players.
- Made dll files. 

#### [Database First Web App](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/DatabaseFirst_Car_Insurance/Car_Insurance)
A Web Application to calculate Car Insurance Rates. It was created using a database first approach with Entity Framework. 
It uses HTML form inputs with if and boolean statements to calculate the rate.
- CRUD functionality. 
- Pass form data to the application to calculate rates and create records. 
- Update results when changes are made to the records. 
- An Admin page displays DB records.
- Used MVC design framework.

#### [Code First Web App](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/CodeFirst_ConsoleApp/548Challenge)
A very basic spinup of a console application to demonstrate using coded models to build a database with Entity Framework.

#### [WebApp Tutorial](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/WebAppTutorial)
A 15 minute mini project to demonstrate how C# scaffolding can make spinning up a basic web page super quick and easy. It has a few basic HTML elements, uses a shared Layout page with navigation bar, and implements CSS and JavaScript.

## [REFERENCE CODE LIBRARY](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp)
In addition to the projects, there is a small code library for referencing basic C# elements. These examples are heavily noted and written as though for a console application. 
- [Basics](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/CSharp_Basics/CSharpBasics/Program.cs) Start here for the fundamentals.
- [Abstract Classes](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/Program.cs) Abstract classes and polymorphism.
- [Abstract Class](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass/ConsoleApp_AbstractClass) An abstract class, aka a base class, is a generic (template) class or type of object that is used as a basis for creating other objects that conform with its specifications.  
- [Arrays and Lists](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ArraysLists/ConsoleApp_ArraysLists/Program.cs) Syntax for arrays and lists. 
- [Chained Constructors](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ChainedConstructors/ConsoleApp_ChainedConstructors) A chained constructor allows programmers to define “default” values for class instances accounting for which property values are passed in when the constructor is called. 
- [DateTime](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_DateTime/ConsoleApp_DateTime/Program.cs) Code examples using type DateTime.
- [Enums](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Enums/ConsoleApp_Enums/Program.cs) An enum is a data type that consists of a set of named values, called elements/members/enumerals/or enumerators. 
- [Events and Delegates](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_EventsAndDelegates) An event is an action that occurs as the result of user action. Here is an example of event and event handler syntax, popular naming convention with events, and custom EventArgs classes.
- [Exception Handling](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_ExceptionHandling/ConsoleApp_ExceptionHandling) Try catch blocks and exception codes.
- [FileIO](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_FileIO_LogToTxtFile/ConsoleApp_FileIO_LogToTxtFile/Program.cs) The FileIO library and how to log to text files. 
- [Input Validation]() Check that user input is type int. 
- [Lambda](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Lambda/ConsoleApp_Lambda) Using lambda expressions, you can write local functions that can be passed as arguments or returned as the value of function calls.
- [Key and Console Modifiers](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Key_Console_Modifiers) Log to the console when key modifiers are pressed. 
- [Methods](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Methods/ConsoleApp_Methods) The basics of C# methods. 
- [Methods and Objects](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_MethodsAndObjects/ConsoleApp_MethodsAndObjects) How to declare objects and their properties, instantiate objects, use var variables, and define methods.
- [Overloaded Operators](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_OverloadOperators/ConsoleApp_OverloadOperators) A coding approach to provide custom implementation of an operation in case one or both of the operands are of that type. 
- [Strings](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Strings/ConsoleApp_Strings/Program.cs) The basics of using this common data type.
- [Structs](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/tree/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Structs/ConsoleApp_Structs) A structure is a value Type used to make a single variable that holds related data of various data types. 
- [Switch](https://github.com/serengetijade/C_Sharp/blob/main/Basic_CSharp/ConsoleApp_Switch/ConsoleApp_Switch/Program.cs) The basics of branching statemetns with the switch keyword.
